# SVGLogoMaker
#Description

For this challenge we were given the oportunity to develop an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) logo generator.  A logo maker like this could potentially help people looking for a simple and straightforward application to provide logos and signs for businesses or personal accounts without hiring a graphic designer.  This application uses the CLI (Command-Line Interface) to not only create the logos via directions but, using jest in tandem, test the accuracy of the logos the application renders.     

#Installation

To install this application, the repository (https://github.com/Myroman81/SVGLogoMaker) must be added to the CLI.  Node must be installed as well.  

#Usage

Video walkthrough to follow.

#Credits

Once again I was helped by my instructor, Leif Hetland, the TA Fred Kamm, my classmates, and my tutor, Erik Hoversten.
